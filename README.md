# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets! (Kaggle challenge)

Project carried out within the framework of my training Data Fullstack, Jedha's Bootcamp Paris. 

Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).
But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster. 

The goal was to predict if a tweet is a real disaster or not. 

The project is divided into two parts:
Part 1 : EDA and all the necessary preprocessings to prepare data for deep learning
Part 2 : Training model (simple RNN model, GRU & LSTM to find the best one)
